Subject: [Kapture-devel] Error while trying to build Kapture
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=vpLLSKD5WyGbzOUEV+emegtOQ=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to build kapture, my end goal is to have is streaming video from
camera on a robot.
The error I get when I am trying to make is:
"
kapture/trunk/src/joystick.cpp:20: error: ?uint32_t? does not name a type
kapture/trunk/src/joystick.cpp:21: error: ?uint32_t? does not name a type
"
. It breaks after [43%]
. and here is the output of cmake (incase it contains useful information)

"

Please let me know if you have any idea as to what is causing this error or
how I can fix it.

Thanks a lot for your help,
Marc

Hi,

I have figured out the error, I just needed to include stdio.h in all the
files, didn't realize that was missing yesterday.
