Subject: [Kapture-devel] FEATURE: Kapture for Qt 4.2

Hello.

I'm a Qt and C++ developer. I'm interested in porting Kapture to Qt
4.2. Is there any recommendation? I have seen that some features, like
SSH, cannot be ported to this version, but I'm not interested. I think
that I could just remove these features if compiling for Qt 4.2 or
lesser.

Also, one more thing: I'm currently having trouble to work with my UVC
webcam for the brightness being too high. Does Kapture provide any
option to handle this issue, maybe by adjusting camera exposure?

Thank you.
